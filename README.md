Rules:

1. There are nine tic-tac-toe boards embedded in a larger board.
2. The first player makes a move in any square on any board.
3. The second player must make a move on the small board which corresponds to the small square played last.
4. When a player completes a three-in-a-row on a small board, that board turns to the player's color.  Note that moves can still be played on this board.
5. A player wins by making a three-in-a-row on the big board, out of small boards which have been won.
